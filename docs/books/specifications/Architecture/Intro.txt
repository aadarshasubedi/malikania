# Architecture

Malikania Engine is exclusively client-server based. While it is strictly a
client-server architecture, it is still possible to write one player games
by running a local server on the user's machine with some effort.

## Server

Everything is computed on the server side to avoid any cheat. That includes:

- Handling authentication,
- Handling players,
- Handling battles,
- Handling moves on maps.

## Client

The client is only responsible of:

- Graphics,
- Sounds,
- Input,
- Connection with server.
