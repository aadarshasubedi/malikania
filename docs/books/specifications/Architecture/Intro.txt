# Architecture

Malikania Engine is exclusively client-server based. While it is strictly a
client-server architecture, it is still possible to write one player games
by running a local server on the user's machine.

## Server

Everything is computed on the server side to avoid any cheat. That includes:

* Handling players,
* Handling battles,
* Handling moves on maps,
* etc.

## Client

The client is only responsible of:

* Graphics,
* Sounds,
* Input,
* Connection with server
