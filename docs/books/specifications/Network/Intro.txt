# Network

Networking in Malikania Engine.

In that part, we will describe messages and requests. The messages come
from the server while the requests come from the clients.

## Syntax

The network protocol use JSON in multiline format.

You can use both Unix or Windows line endings. However, to terminate
a message, an empty line must be added and terminated by '\\r\\n'.

**Example:**

1. This is a simple single-line message

````json
{ "command": "reload" }
````

2. This is a multi-lines message

````json
{
  "command": "identify",
  "nickname": "foo",
}
````
