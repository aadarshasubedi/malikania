## malikania-vm

The `malikania-vm` tool is the most important tool within the Malikania Engine
framework.

Because Malikania Engine is backward compatible only with minor versions (as
specified by semver), it is sometimes necessary to install multiple major
versions of the Malikania Engine.

To facilitate the launch of the games, the malikania-vm tool will use the
appropriate version of the engine according to the game requirements.

Because of that, this tool is built as a completely separate project and MUST
be present before installation of any engine.

The malikania-vm provides all the wrappers for every other Malikania Engine
tools.

### Installing new Malikania Engine version

When a Malikania Engine version is installed, it also register itself to a small
file kept by malikania-vm.

This can be done from the Malikania Engine install target or by hand with the
malikania-vm utility directly.

**Note**: because Malikania Engine is backward compatible with minor versions,
it does not make sense to install two versions from the same major version.

Bad example:

- 1.0.6
- 1.2.4

Correct example:

- 1.4.0
- 2.7

### The Malikania-VM JSON description file

The malikania-vm stores all engines installed into a JSON file. It is installed
by default in:

- **PREFIX/etc/malikania/vm.json**

````json
[
  {
    "version": "1.0.6",
    "prefix": "/usr/local",
    "execdir": "libexec/malikania/1.0.6",
    "libdir": "lib",
    "dbdir": "lib/malikania/1.0.6",
    "datadir": "share/malikania/1.0.6",
    "docdir": "doc/malikania/1.0.6",
    "etcdir": "etc/malikania/1.0.6"
  }
]
````

- **version**: the engine version
- **prefix**: Optional, the prefix where installed (if set, MUST be absolute)
- **execdir**: Optional, the directory where to store Malikania Engine binaries
- **libdir**: Optional, the directory where Malikania Engine public libraries are stored
- **dbdir**: Optional, the directory where database backends are stored
- **datadir**: Optional, the directory where Malikania Engine data are stored
- **docdir**: Optional, the directory where Malikania Engine documentation are stored
- **etcdir**: Optional, the directory where Malikania Engine configuration are stored

**Note**: If any of **execdir**, **libdir**, **dbdir**, **datadir**, **docdir**,
**etcdir** is not absolute, then it is relative to the prefix (recommended).

### Command line usage

(@) `malikania-vm list`
(@) `malikania-vm unregister version`
(@) `malikania-vm register version [-p prefix] [-e execdir] [-l libdir] [-d dbdir]
[-s datadir] [-D docdir] [-c etcdir]`

**Signature (1)**

List all Malikania Engine installations.

**Signature (2)**

Remove the specified Malikania Engine version from the registry (not from the
disk).

**Signature (3)**

Add a new Malikania Engine version to the Malikania VM registry.

### CMake module

The malikania-vm tool installs **MalikaniaVMConfig.cmake**, the Malikania Engine
can set `MALIKANIA_VM_NO_REGISTER` before including the file so that the install
target does not register itself to the malikania-vm (not recommended).
