## Animations

The animations are animated sprites. They provide a convenient way of drawing
animations onto the screen because they update themselves automatically.

Animations use [Sprites][] to be shown.

### JSON description

A JSON file is always associated with an animation. If you have ten animations, you have ten JSON files for them.

````json
{
  "alias": "Fire",
  "sprite": "Fire-sprite",
  "frames": [
    { "delay": 100, "cell": 1 },
    { "delay": 105, "cell": 0 }
  ]
}
````

- **alias**: the name required to register the animation
- **sprite**: the sprite name (the sprite's alias)
- **frames**: for each frame the following:
	- **delay**: the delay in milliseconds
	- **cell**: (Optional) the cell index

With that following code, a file will be generated with the following images:

1. delay of 100 ms before switching to the second frame
2. delay of 105 ms before switching finishing the animation
