## Animations

The animations are animated sprites. They are described in JSON.

### JSON description

A JSON file is always associated with an animation. If you have ten animations, you have ten JSON files for them.

````json
[
	{ "delay": 100, "image" : "fire-1.png" },
	{ "delay": 105, "image": "fire-2.png" }
]
````

With that following code, a file will be generated with the following images:

* *fire-1.png*, delay of 100 ms before switching to the second frame
* *fire-2.png*, delay of 105 ms before switching finishing the animation
