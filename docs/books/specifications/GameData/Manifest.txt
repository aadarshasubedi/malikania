## Manifest

The manifest file tells the engine how many files for each component are
available.

It is mandatory to list all of the game data.

### JSON description

The file is named `manifest.json` and is installed in the root game directory.

````json
{
  "images": [
    "images/wood.png",
    "images/cat.png"
  ],
  "spells": [
    "spells/fire.js"
  ]
}
````

You can use the [malikania-bundle][] tool to create manifest files
automatically.
