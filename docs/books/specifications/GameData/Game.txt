- **name**: the game name,
- **authors**: the game authors (at least one),
- **version**: the game version as string, can be arbitrary,
- **requires**: the required version of Malikania Engine, see below
- **license**: (Optional) the license,

**About the version**

There is no specific format for the **requires** field, you just specify a
version (at least major).

Because Malikania Engine is backward compatible only with minor versions (as
specified in the semver specification) the game is automatically disabled
if tried to be ran from an incompatible Malikania Engine version.

**Example**

1. You have developed your game using Malikania Engine 1.3.2, then set **requires**
to "1.3.2", It will be compatible with any version greater or equal to 1.3.2 but
not with version greater or equal to 2.0.0.

2. You have developed your game using Malikania Engine 1.0, you can just set
**requires** to "1".
